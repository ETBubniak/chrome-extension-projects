this extension will allow you to designate a folder with sub-folders.

It will iterate over each subfolder and open one bookmark from each subfolder. If the 
folder has any direct bookmarks, it will pick one at random and open it as well.

Ex:

Folder
- Subfolder 1
-- Bookmark A
-- Bookmark B
-- Bookmark C
- Subfolder 2
-- Bookmark D
-- Bookmark E
-- Bookmark F
- Subfolder 3
-- Bookmark G
-- Bookmark H
-- Bookmark I
- Bookmark J
- Bookmark K

Running this with Folder designated might cause, for instance, Bookmarks A, E, H, and J 
to open.
